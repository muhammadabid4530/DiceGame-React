### How to Play Dice Game

The `Rules` component provides instructions on how to play the dice game. Here's a breakdown of the rules:

1. **Select any number**: Choose a number you think the dice will land on.

2. **Click on dice image**: Click on the dice image to roll the dice.

3. **Guess correctly**: If your selected number matches the dice number, you'll earn points equal to the dice number.

4. **Wrong guess penalty**: If your guess is incorrect, points will be deducted equal to the dice number.

### Styling

The `Rules` component is styled using styled-components. It features a light pink background, padding, and maximum width/height for a clean presentation.
